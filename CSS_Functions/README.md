Functions in CSS

In a broad sense, functions are blocks of organized and reusable code that help to perform a single, related action.

Functions have the benefit of keeping code modular and allowing for a high degree of reusability.

Functions in CSS are a little more limiting than most programming languages. We cannot create our own functions in CSS but instead have access to a wide variety of predefined functions, which allow for expansive page styling.
