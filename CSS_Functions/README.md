Functions in CSS

In a broad sense, functions are blocks of organized and reusable code that help to perform a single, related action.

Functions have the benefit of keeping code modular and allowing for a high degree of reusability.

Functions in CSS are a little more limiting than most programming languages. We cannot create our own functions in CSS but instead have access to a wide variety of predefined functions, which allow for expansive page styling.

Functions are a type of CSS value that is inserted in the place of a hardcoded value of a CSS declaration. Some functions can even take multiple arguments, generally each of which must be separated by a comma.
