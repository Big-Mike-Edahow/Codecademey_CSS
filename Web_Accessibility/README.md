Web accessibility is one of those aspects of web development where its presence, when implemented correctly, goes unnoticed, but its absence can destroy the user experience.

There are a variety of considerations to make when making a website accessible, ranging from the size and color of the text to invisible properties that are processed by assistive tools such as screen readers.

Paragraph width can also impact readability. It is recommended to have 45 to 85 characters per line, with the ideal being suggested as 65 characters. px is a unit of measure. A more appropriate unit for this purpose is the ch unit, with 1ch being equivalent to the width of the zero (0) character. The ch unit also scales with changes in the value of the font-family or font-size property.
