Web accessibility is one of those aspects of web development where its presence, when implemented correctly, goes unnoticed, but its absence can destroy the user experience.

There are a variety of considerations to make when making a website accessible, ranging from the size and color of the text to invisible properties that are processed by assistive tools such as screen readers.

Paragraph width can also impact readability. It is recommended to have 45 to 85 characters per line, with the ideal being suggested as 65 characters. px is a unit of measure. A more appropriate unit for this purpose is the ch unit, with 1ch being equivalent to the width of the zero (0) character. The ch unit also scales with changes in the value of the font-family or font-size property.

Two colors are contrasting when they are from different segments of the color wheel. Thus, the farther apart the segments, the higher the contrast between the two colors. The difference between the two colors is known as the contrast ratio and a minimum contrast ratio must be met in order to adhere to accessibility standards. The minimum contrast ratio denotes how high the contrast is between the text of certain sizes and width on a specific background. This ratio can range from 1:1, where both compared colors are the same, to 21:1, where the two colors are black and white.

Design Reflecting Structure

An important consideration when applying CSS to a page is the relationship that the CSS stylesheet has with the HTML documentâ€™s underlying structure. The order and structure of the HTML elements and CSS properties should match the order and structure of the Document Object Model.
