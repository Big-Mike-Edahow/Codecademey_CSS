BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

We can check whether a CSS feature is available on specific browsers using tools like caniuse.com.

Browsers have default styles which we can check using resources like browserdefaultstyles.com.

We sometimes need to use browser-specific prefixes, especially for new CSS features.

Polyfills provide a way to support newer web features on older browsers.
