COLOR FOR UI

Buttons

Buttons are one type of element where accent colors can be used effectively. As these provide ways for the user to navigate, submit a form, or move onto the next task, the color of a button can determine a lot in the user’s eyes.

In addition to selecting the right color for your buttons, there are different states a button has as the user interacts with them. These different states provide a visible signal to the user that an interaction is or is not possible. Two common states used are the hover state and the disabled state.

The hover state typically features a shade or tint of the accent color used for the buttons. This helps a user comprehend that something is happening as they scroll over top of an action.

Forms

Form inputs are another type of component that use color to indicate an action to a user. Similar to buttons, form inputs have certain states.

There is the default state, which is how the user views the inputs when they first arrive at a page.

The second state is the selected, or active, state. These provide the user with a visual cue that they have highlighted the field and have the ability to type within it. This is typically achieved by using a border color or a box shadow effect.

If the input field is unable to be edited or typed within, there should be a disabled state as well. This should render much like the disabled button, in that it is grayed out.

Inputs also have other colors that indicate success and failure. These are called semantic colors.

Semantic Colors

In addition to your brand and accent colors, you have to remember to provide additional indications to the user when something goes right or wrong.

People make mistakes. We’re all human. So when designing user input elements, you must understand that errors will arise. When this happens, users should be alerted to understand where they went wrong. A common design pattern color used for this indicator is red.

Red is also used to provide more emphasis for delete buttons. If the user wishes or is required to delete something, it should be abundantly clear that the delete action is different from a normal action.

On the other hand, when a user achieves their goal without issue or does something right, you should reward them! A good way to do that is through the use of green as a success message. Green is also often used for actions that entice the user to submit, move forward, or go.

Not all errors are caused by the user. Sometimes, the code just breaks! If an error occurs on the website and we need to notify the user, we should consider selecting a color that indicates the issue level and one that does not conflict with our action colors. A typical color for these warning situations is yellow.

Default Colors

Next, let’s discuss default or structural colors. Almost every site you design will incorporate black, white, and shades of gray in some way. These default colors are used often as the color for text within your designs, as they provide plenty of contrast for reading and can fit into many other different color schemes.

When selecting the color of your text, it’s important to ensure the contrast is high enough for the text to be legible. However, too much contrast can also be an issue.

Pure black on white can be hard on the user’s eyes because of the stark contrast. Using a darker gray for text on a white background, or white text on a dark gray background, helps soften the feel while still providing clear enough contrast to be legible without issue.

Neutral Colors

It’s important to consider how contrast will also be affected when using different colors for backgrounds and text.

Neutral colors, or hues with low lightness and/or saturation, make for good base colors as it allows you to add flourishes to the parts of the site where you want to direct the user’s attention.

For example, similar to using a dark gray with white text, you can use a darker shade of a color with light colored text. Using a medium shade or tint of a color can be difficult to achieve the same result, as the contrast is lower.

Whitespace

Space is an important aspect of creating balanced and harmonious layouts in web design. As a designer, it’s important to understand how space can enhance as well as hurt your designs.

Whitespace, or negative space, refers to the emptiness between elements. It’s not necessarily white in color, even though, that is sometimes the case.

For example, you will notice that Google embraces whitespace on its landing page. It focuses the user’s attention solely on the primary action, which is searching for content.

Too much whitespace can negatively impact the flow of your site. By including too much spacing in-between elements, it can cause issues for users trying to navigate seamlessly through the content.
