<b>Color Design</b>

Color is essential to the overall aesthetics and usability of your websites.

With <strong><em>16.8 million colors</em></strong> to choose from, the possibilities are endless. Understanding how to select and use colors properly and effectively can impact the quality as well as how users comprehend and use your website.

Before selecting and applying color to your projects, it’s essential to gain an understanding of:

Which colors pair well with others.

What color schemes are available to produce effective designs.

Which emotions each color evokes and communicates.

How contrast plays a vital role.

What color combinations you should avoid.

HSLA is the most semantic system of setting colors with CSS.

The “pure” color is set with the Hue. This is expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel.

Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of that hue. Colors with full saturation (100%) are the color itself, colors with no saturation (0%) are completely grayscale.
Lightness refers to the lightness of the color. 0% is black, 100% is white.

A, or alpha, refers to the opacity. 0% is fully transparent, 100% is fully opaque.

Using values that have semantic meaning gives the designer more direct control over the color scheme, and more direct ability to manage contrast and create related color schemes.
